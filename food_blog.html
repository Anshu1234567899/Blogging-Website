        <h2>Delicious Pizza</h2>
        <p><h1>How to make pizza...?</h1>

            <h2>Step 1: Prepare the dough</h2>
            <h3>Activate the yeast: In a bowl, combine 1 cup of warm water with 1 tsp of sugar. Sprinkle the active dry yeast over the water and let it sit for 5‚Äì10 minutes until it becomes foamy.
            Make the dough: In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 ¬Ω cups of all-purpose flour, 1 tsp of salt, and optional garlic powder and oregano. Add the yeast mixture and 1 tbsp of olive oil. Mix everything together and knead it for about 7‚Äì10 minutes, until you get a smooth dough.
            Let it rise: Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1‚Äì1.5 hours, or until it doubles in size.</h3>

            <h2>Step 2: Prepare the pizza</h2>
            <h3>Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to 475¬∞F (245¬∞C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating to get it hot.
            Roll out the dough: Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air. Roll it out on a floured surface to your desired thickness (usually about 12 inches for a standard pizza).
            Transfer to a baking sheet or pizza stone: Place the rolled dough onto a greased baking sheet or a preheated pizza stone.
            Add the toppings: Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce over the dough. Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese. Add your favorite toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, olives, onions, etc.).
            Brush with olive oil: Optionally, you can brush the edges of the crust with olive oil for a golden, crispy finish.</h3>

           <h2> Step 3: Bake the pizza</h2>
           <h3> Bake in the oven: Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for about 10‚Äì12 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the crust is golden brown.
            Optional ‚Äì Garnish: After baking, you can garnish with fresh basil leaves for extra flavor.</h3>

           <h2> Step 4: Serve</h2>
            <h3>Slice and serve: Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a minute or two before slicing and serving. Enjoy your homemade pizza!</h3>

            <h2>Tips:</h2>
           <h3> You can use a pizza stone for a crispier crust.
            For a crispy crust, preheat the baking sheet in the oven before placing the pizza on it.
            Experiment with toppings and sauces to create your favorite combinations!</h3>

        <h2>Yummy Pasta</h2>
        <p><h1>How to make pasta.....? </h1>
        
            <h2>Step 1: Cook the pasta</h2>
            <h3>Boil water: In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add a generous amount of salt to the water (this helps flavor the pasta).
            Cook the pasta: Once the water is boiling, add your pasta and cook according to the package instructions, usually 8-10 minutes, or until it's al dente (tender but still firm to the bite).
            Drain the pasta: Once cooked, drain the pasta, reserving about ¬Ω cup of pasta water (you can use this to adjust the sauce later). Set asid.</h3>
            
            <h2>Step 2: Prepare the creamy tomato sauce</h2>
           <h3> Saut√© onions and garlic: In a large pan, heat the olive oil (or butter) over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until it becomes soft and translucent (about 3‚Äì4 minutes). Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 30 seconds, until fragrant.
            Add crushed tomatoes: Pour in the can of crushed tomatoes and stir. Let it simmer for about 5-7 minutes, allowing the flavors to combine.
            Add cream and seasonings: Lower the heat and stir in the heavy cream (or milk). Add the dried basil, oregano, salt, pepper, and red chili flakes (if you want some spice). Let it simmer for another 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
            Adjust the sauce: If the sauce gets too thick, you can add some reserved pasta water to reach your desired consistency.</h3>

            <h2>Step 3: Combine pasta and sauce</h2>
            <h3>Mix pasta and sauce: Once the sauce is ready, add the cooked pasta to the pan with the sauce. Toss to combine, ensuring all the pasta is coated with the creamy tomato sauce.
            Heat through: Let everything cook together for 2‚Äì3 minutes to let the pasta absorb some of the sauce.</h3>

            <h2>Step 4: Serve</h2>
            <h3>Garnish and serve: Plate the pasta and garnish with fresh basil leaves (optional) and a generous sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese.
            Enjoy! Your creamy tomato pasta is ready to serve! Pair it with garlic bread or a side salad if desired.</h3>

            <h2>Tips:</h2>
            <h3>For extra flavor, you can add a pinch of sugar to the sauce to balance out the acidity of the tomatoes.
            Add vegetables like spinach, bell peppers, or mushrooms to the sauce for added texture and nutrition.
            If you prefer a spicy sauce, you can add more red chili flakes or even a little bit of hot sauce.
            You can also make the sauce in advance and refrigerate it for later use.</h3>
